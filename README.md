# CppMaxFinderInClass


## Introduction

This C++ program defines a class called `Number` that encapsulates the logic for inputting data and finding the maximum number within the class itself. The program creates three instances of the `Number` class to find the maximum numbers for each set of elements and finally compares the maximums to find the overall maximum.

### Motivation

This program was created as a simple example of object-oriented programming in C++. It demonstrates how to encapsulate data and functionality within a class and use instances of that class to perform a specific taskâ€”in this case, finding the maximum number among multiple sets of data.


#### Code Structure
main.cpp: The main C++ program file that includes the Number class and the main function.
Number class: Defines the Number class, which contains methods for getting data and finding the maximum number within the class.


#### Example
Suppose you input the following sets of numbers:

Set 1: 5 10 15 20 25
Set 2: 30 35 40 45 50
Set 3: 55 60 65 70 75

The program will output:
Maximum number among the sets: 75
