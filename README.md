# CppMaxFinderInClass


## Introduction

This C++ program defines a class called `Number` that encapsulates the logic for inputting data and finding the maximum number within the class itself. The program creates three instances of the `Number` class to find the maximum numbers for each set of elements and finally compares the maximums to find the overall maximum.

### Motivation

This program was created as a simple example of object-oriented programming in C++. It demonstrates how to encapsulate data and functionality within a class and use instances of that class to perform a specific taskâ€”in this case, finding the maximum number among multiple sets of data.
